# Welcome to **"Brain games"**
With this program you can test your knowledge of mathematics.
You will have the opportunity to play five games:
1) "Parity Check".
2) "Calculator".
3) "GCD" (Greatest common divisor).
4) "Arithmetic progression".
5) "Is it a prime number?".

## Instructions

**To start the game, type in the console:**

1) ```brain-even``` - to start game "Parity Check".

You can also watch the video instructions.
